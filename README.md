# Responsive Portfolio

## Description

This is the readme for the responsive portfolio of Raffi Lepejian. This project contains 3 webpages. The Homepage, or about-me page, contains an image and then a short blurb about me as well as a navbar and a footer. The portfolio page contains several rows and columns of images as well as the navbar and footer. The contact page contains the navbar and footer as well as titled forms (currently non-functional) for contacting me and leaving an email address for responses. All pages are designed to dynamically resize and reformat based on window size, with explicit additions in the form of media queries at widths of 992 pixels, 768 pixels, and 400 pixels.

## Code Snippet

This code snippet shows the css formatting that occurs when the window is thinner than 992 pixels. This snippet was included because the purpose of the excercise was to make a website that reformats itself dynamically in response to window size, and this snippet is closely aligned with that goal.
```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
    #about-me{
        padding-left: 10px;
        padding-right: 10px;
        padding-bottom: 20px;
        left: 15px;
    }
    #portfolio-block {
        width: 700px;
    }
    }

```
