## Code Snippet

This code snippet shows the css formatting that occurs when the window is thinner than 992 pixels. This snippet was included because the purpose of the excercise was to make a website that reformats itself dynamically in response to window size, and this snippet is closely aligned with that goal.
```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
    #about-me{
        padding-left: 10px;
        padding-right: 10px;
        padding-bottom: 20px;
        left: 15px;
    }
    #portfolio-block {
        width: 700px;
    }
    }

```
